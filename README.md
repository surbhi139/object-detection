# object-detection


here we are detecting the object using image processing.image processing can be done for anything when it connects to the camera. through machine learning and deep learning it can detects the object about any type through which explains the objects.

in this code it will detect any object whether it is a person or any object or pet.
using the webcam we can detect the object.

for object detection, we are using the bounding boxes which have the shape of a square and also tell about which item or a person showing on a webcam. 
opencv library is used for image processing. opencv is the computer vision library for the image detection.

for the dataset, we are using the coco dataset 2020 which was created for object detection. this dataset has 80 objects which were detected by the camera.
you can download the data through **https://cocodataset.org/#home**

for building the model we are using the DNA detection model for detecting the object. to study more about the model you can use the website **https://learnopencv.com/deep-learning-with-opencvs-dnn-module-a-definitive-guide/**. this website will tell you about the model using the opencv library.

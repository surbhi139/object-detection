# object-detection


here we are detecting the object using image processing.
it can detect any object whether it is a person or any object or pet. it can detect it. 
using the webcam we can detect the object.


for object detection, we are using the bounding boxes which have the shape of a square and also tell about which item or a person showing on a webcam.  


for the dataset, we are using the coco dataset 2020 which was created for object detection. this dataset has 80 objects which were detected by the camera.

for building the model we are using the DNA detection model for detecting the object.
